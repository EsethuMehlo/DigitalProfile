# REFLECTIONS
---


### Career Counselling
---

I went in this assignment with many questions on my mind about which careeer to focus on within the IT industry with it's vast opportunities and careers. I thought that the course I am currently doing was going to be the answer but it provided me with more options instead which fueled my indecisiveness even further.
I was basically was tasked with narrowing all these oppportunities.
I went in this task with an open and an honest mind. I was honest with myself. 
In the end of this task I found a the correct career for me and what is truly ideal for me

### Skills And Interests
---
Growing up as an atheletic child, I had a huge problem with knowing what I really am good at in terms of talants and skills.

With a heavy task to find what I am good at and how I can leverage it to my chosen careers I had to make a chance.
I went into the Skills and Interests assessment with honesty and less emotion. I went in t woth  aligning all skills and talents I have with my current interests and hobbies
.
The result of this was find what I relly want from the workplace, my career and from myself as well. I know for sure that I want a career in IT that will align with my good communication skills and many other soft skills that make me happy tp express especially that will help my fellow people.

### Create a CV
---
We all thinkn writing a CV is writing your name and your qualifications only. 
This task showed me something else. I will not lie, I was shown how much vital a CV is.
I had to use the CV's importance in my professional and align it with myself entirely. 
I was able to create a CV that highlghted more than just my name and my qualifications. I was able to cyrate a CV that  would show potential employers how I much I am attraction for them. It oultlined what they would receive from and showed all of my history , thanks to the course I was given. I basically amde use of that information and submitted it that CV on the CV submission link or task.


### Personality Assessment
---

One thing that we never think in terms of choosing careers is choosing careers and workplaces that will fit precisely with the type of personalities we have. 

With a heavy task to find what I am good at and how I can leverage it to my chosen careers I had to make a chance.
So I decdied to go into the Personality assessment honestly for a good result as this is vital for me as a person.

The result of this was find what I relly want from the workplace in terms of my personality. I now know hw importat to find a work enviroment that compliment my perfectionistic personality and as well as my hardworking traits as well.
