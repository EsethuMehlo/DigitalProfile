# REFLECTIONS
---


### Career Counselling
---

I went in this assignment with many questions on my mind about which careeer to focus on within the IT industry with it's vast opportunities and careers. I thought that the course I am currently doing was going to be the answer but it provided me with more options instead which fueled my indecisiveness even further.
I was basically was tasked with narrowing all these oppportunities.
I went in this task with an open and an honest mind. I was honest with myself. 
In the end of this task I found a the correct career for me and what is truly ideal for me

### Skills And Interests
---
Growing up as an atheletic child, I had a huge problem with knowing what I really am good at in terms of talants and skills.

With a heavy task to find what I am good at and how I can leverage it to my chosen careers I had to make a chance.
I went into the Skills and Interests assessment with honesty and less emotion. I went in t woth  aligning all skills and talents I have with my current interests and hobbies
.
The result of this was find what I relly want from the workplace, my career and from myself as well. I know for sure that I want a career in IT that will align with my good communication skills and many other soft skills that make me happy tp express especially that will help my fellow people.

### Create a CV
---
We all thinkn writing a CV is writing your name and your qualifications only. 
This task showed me something else. I will not lie, I was shown how much vital a CV is.
I had to use the CV's importance in my professional and align it with myself entirely. 
I was able to create a CV that highlghted more than just my name and my qualifications. I was able to cyrate a CV that  would show potential employers how I much I am attraction for them. It oultlined what they would receive from and showed all of my history , thanks to the course I was given. I basically amde use of that information and submitted it that CV on the CV submission link or task.


### Personality Assessment
---

One thing that we never think in terms of choosing careers is choosing careers and workplaces that will fit precisely with the type of personalities we have. 

With a heavy task to find what I am good at and how I can leverage it to my chosen careers I had to make a chance.
So I decdied to go into the Personality assessment honestly for a good result as this is vital for me as a person.

The result of this was find what I relly want from the workplace in terms of my personality. I now know how importat to find a work enviroment that compliment my perfectionistic personality and as well as my hardworking traits as well.

### Mock Interview
---
#### Situation
I recently participated in a mock interview session. Even though I have attended several interviews in the past, this one introduced a completely new dynamic and level of pressure. It was far more intense than I expected for a practice setting.

#### Task
My goal was to test and sharpen my interview readiness, identify my blind spots, and understand how I perform under structured interview conditions—especially as I prepare for future opportunities in the Information Technology field.

#### Action
I went through the full process as if it were a real interview. I engaged with the questions, navigated the pressure, reflected on my communication style, and evaluated how I presented my technical and professional competencies. Throughout the mock interview, I made mental notes of areas where I could improve, such as managing stress and structuring my responses more effectively.

#### Result
The experience became a major learning curve. Despite my past interview exposure, this mock interview challenged me in unexpected ways and highlighted how different structured practice can feel compared to real interviews. I left the session with valuable insights and a clearer understanding of how to elevate my future performance. I’m now more confident and eager to leverage these learnings to improve my approach in upcoming IT job interviews.

### Workplace Etiquette

---
## Situation
After I finished the Workplace Etiquette module, I realised how eye-opening it was. Even though everyone knows the module, I did not expect it to shift my thinking this much. Coming from a student background, I saw how different the expectations are when you step into a real workplace.

#### Task
My aim was to understand how to behave and carry myself as an employee, not just as a student. I wanted to learn more than just the duties of a specific IT job—I needed to understand the general standards, the culture, and the professional behaviour that workplaces expect.

#### Action
I paid close attention to the lessons in the module and reflected on how they apply in real organisations. I focused on things like communication, time management, respect in the workplace, and how to handle myself professionally. I compared these expectations to how I normally operate as a student and looked for ways to improve and adapt.

#### Result
Completing the module changed my understanding of the workplace in a big way. It helped me see that professionalism is not only about doing the job well—it is also about how you speak, behave, and work with others. I now feel more prepared and confident about entering the working world because I understand what is expected from me as an employee, not just an IT student.

---
### Professional Networking

---
#### Situation
After completing the Professional Networking module, I realised how powerful and essential networking is, especially in the IT field. Before this, I did not fully understand how important my connections and relationships were in building my career.

#### Task
My aim was to understand how to build and maintain professional relationships in a responsible and effective way. I wanted to learn how to network without overstepping boundaries or misusing opportunities.

#### Action
Throughout the module, I explored how to use both in-person interactions and online platforms to grow my professional presence. I also learned the importance of balance—using networking wisely without abusing it, because it can backfire. I reflected on how I can use the internet, social media, and even my own circle of friends and colleagues to open future opportunities.

#### Result
The module opened my eyes to the real value of networking and showed me that it is something I need to practice everywhere and anywhere. It also taught me to approach it responsibly and respectfully. I now feel better prepared to build meaningful professional relationships and to use my environment and the internet to my advantage. I am truly grateful for the insights this module gave me.

---
### Interview Skills 

---

#### Situation
After I finished the Interview Skills module, I realised how much I still had to learn about interviews, even though I have been to several before. The module opened my eyes to the deeper techniques and expectations behind a professional interview in the IT field.

#### Task
My goal was to strengthen my interview abilities so that I can confidently face future IT employers. I wanted to understand what to expect in an interview and how to respond in a way that shows my strengths clearly.

#### Action
I engaged fully with the material and took in the practical skills taught in the module. I focused on understanding how to structure my answers, how to present myself, and how to manage interview pressure. I added every new skill and insight to my “interview toolkit,” and reflected on how these strategies apply in real situations.

#### Result
The module greatly improved my confidence and expanded my interview skills arsenal. I now feel more prepared and aware of what happens inside the interview room. Even though I have not yet had the chance to use these new skills, I am ready and excited to apply them when the opportunity comes. This learning experience has strengthened my readiness for future IT interviews.
