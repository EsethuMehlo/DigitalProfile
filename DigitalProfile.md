# REFLECTIONS
---


### Career Counselling
---

#### Situation
I started this assignment with many questions about which career path to follow in the IT industry. The field is full of different opportunities, and instead of finding clarity, I felt even more unsure. I had hoped that my current course would point me in one clear direction, but it actually opened up even more options, which increased my indecisiveness.

#### Task
My task was to narrow down all these opportunities and identify a career path that fit me best. I needed to reflect deeply and make an honest decision about what direction I truly wanted to follow.

#### Action
I approached the assignment with an open and honest mindset. I took time to reflect on my strengths, interests, and long-term goals. I allowed myself to be truthful about what I enjoy, what motivates me, and what career path I can realistically grow in.

#### Result
By the end of the assignment, I found a career choice that fits me and aligns with who I am. I gained clarity and confidence, and I now understand the path that is ideal for me moving forward.

---
### Skills And Interests
---

#### Situation
Growing up as an athletic child, I always struggled to understand what my real talents and skills were outside of sports. I often questioned what I was truly good at and how those abilities could support my future career.

#### Task
The task required me to identify my strengths and understand how I could use them in the IT career path I am working toward. I needed to take a deep look at myself and make a clear decision about what skills I could rely on moving forward.

#### Action
I approached the Skills and Interests assessment with honesty and without too much emotion. I focused on aligning my natural talents, my personal strengths, and the hobbies I enjoy with my career goals. I took time to be realistic about what I can do well and what brings me genuine satisfaction.

#### Result
Through this process, I discovered what I truly want from the workplace, my career, and even from myself. I now know that I want an IT career that connects with my strong communication skills and other soft skills I enjoy using. I also realised that I want a role where I can help people while still growing professionally. This reflection gave me clarity and confidence in the direction I want to take.

---
### Create a CV
---

#### Situation
I used to think that writing a CV was just about listing your name and qualifications. This task showed me that a CV is much more important and can say a lot about a person to potential employers.

#### Task
The task required me to create a CV that was not only accurate but also professional and appealing to employers. I had to understand how to present myself in a way that highlighted my strengths and made me stand out.

#### Action
I focused on using the CV to reflect my full professional potential. I carefully aligned my skills, experiences, and accomplishments with what employers would find valuable. I incorporated my learning from the course to create a CV that went beyond just my name and qualifications, highlighting what I can contribute and the value I bring.

#### Result
As a result, I produced a CV that truly represents me and my potential. It communicates my strengths, experience, and achievements in a way that attracts employers. I submitted this CV on the task link, confident that it showcases me as a strong candidate and professional.

---
### Personality Assessment
---

#### Situation
One thing we rarely consider when choosing a career is how our personality fits with the workplace. I realised that finding a career and environment that matches my personality is just as important as the job itself.

#### Task
The task required me to discover my personality traits and understand how they can influence my career choices. I needed to honestly identify my strengths and preferences to find the best work environment for me.

#### Action
I approached the Personality Assessment with honesty, focusing on getting accurate results that truly reflect who I am. I carefully analysed the outcomes to see how my traits, such as perfectionism and hard work, could align with potential careers and workplaces.

#### Result
Through this process, I gained clarity on what I truly want from a work environment. I now understand the importance of choosing a workplace that complements my personality, allowing me to thrive and use my strengths effectively. This reflection has given me confidence in making career decisions that fit both my skills and personal traits.

---
### Mock Interview
---
#### Situation
I recently participated in a mock interview session. Even though I have attended several interviews in the past, this one introduced a completely new dynamic and level of pressure. It was far more intense than I expected for a practice setting.

#### Task
My goal was to test and sharpen my interview readiness, identify my blind spots, and understand how I perform under structured interview conditions—especially as I prepare for future opportunities in the Information Technology field.

#### Action
I went through the full process as if it were a real interview. I engaged with the questions, navigated the pressure, reflected on my communication style, and evaluated how I presented my technical and professional competencies. Throughout the mock interview, I made mental notes of areas where I could improve, such as managing stress and structuring my responses more effectively.

#### Result
The experience became a major learning curve. Despite my past interview exposure, this mock interview challenged me in unexpected ways and highlighted how different structured practice can feel compared to real interviews. I left the session with valuable insights and a clearer understanding of how to elevate my future performance. I’m now more confident and eager to leverage these learnings to improve my approach in upcoming IT job interviews.

### Workplace Etiquette

---
## Situation
After I finished the Workplace Etiquette module, I realised how eye-opening it was. Even though everyone knows the module, I did not expect it to shift my thinking this much. Coming from a student background, I saw how different the expectations are when you step into a real workplace.

#### Task
My aim was to understand how to behave and carry myself as an employee, not just as a student. I wanted to learn more than just the duties of a specific IT job—I needed to understand the general standards, the culture, and the professional behaviour that workplaces expect.

#### Action
I paid close attention to the lessons in the module and reflected on how they apply in real organisations. I focused on things like communication, time management, respect in the workplace, and how to handle myself professionally. I compared these expectations to how I normally operate as a student and looked for ways to improve and adapt.

#### Result
Completing the module changed my understanding of the workplace in a big way. It helped me see that professionalism is not only about doing the job well—it is also about how you speak, behave, and work with others. I now feel more prepared and confident about entering the working world because I understand what is expected from me as an employee, not just an IT student.

---
### Professional Networking

---
#### Situation
After completing the Professional Networking module, I realised how powerful and essential networking is, especially in the IT field. Before this, I did not fully understand how important my connections and relationships were in building my career.

#### Task
My aim was to understand how to build and maintain professional relationships in a responsible and effective way. I wanted to learn how to network without overstepping boundaries or misusing opportunities.

#### Action
Throughout the module, I explored how to use both in-person interactions and online platforms to grow my professional presence. I also learned the importance of balance using networking wisely without abusing it, because it can backfire. I reflected on how I can use the internet, social media, and even my own circle of friends and colleagues to open future opportunities.

#### Result
The module opened my eyes to the real value of networking and showed me that it is something I need to practice everywhere and anywhere. It also taught me to approach it responsibly and respectfully. I now feel better prepared to build meaningful professional relationships and to use my environment and the internet to my advantage. I am truly grateful for the insights this module gave me.

---
### Interview Skills 

---

#### Situation
After I finished the Interview Skills module, I realised how much I still had to learn about interviews, even though I have been to several before. The module opened my eyes to the deeper techniques and expectations behind a professional interview in the IT field.

#### Task
My goal was to strengthen my interview abilities so that I can confidently face future IT employers. I wanted to understand what to expect in an interview and how to respond in a way that shows my strengths clearly.

#### Action
I engaged fully with the material and took in the practical skills taught in the module. I focused on understanding how to structure my answers, how to present myself, and how to manage interview pressure. I added every new skill and insight to my “interview toolkit,” and reflected on how these strategies apply in real situations.

#### Result
The module greatly improved my confidence and expanded my interview skills arsenal. I now feel more prepared and aware of what happens inside the interview room. Even though I have not yet had the chance to use these new skills, I am ready and excited to apply them when the opportunity comes. This learning experience has strengthened my readiness for future IT interviews.

### Business Communication

---

#### Situation
After I finished the Business Communication module, I realised how much I needed to improve the way I communicate in both professional and personal environments. The module opened my eyes to how important clear, respectful, and accountable communication is, no matter who I am speaking to.

#### Task
My goal was to understand how to communicate effectively with different people in a workplace hierarchy. I wanted to learn how to show respect, take responsibility for my words and actions, and consider the impact of my communication on others.

#### Action
I paid close attention to the lessons and reflected on how they apply across different areas of life. I learned how to adjust my communication depending on who I am addressing, whether it is a manager, colleague, or someone junior. I also focused on accountability and thought about how being responsible for my communication builds trust and professionalism.

#### Result
The module taught me valuable skills that go far beyond the workplace. I learned the importance of respecting everyone and taking each person into consideration when I communicate. These lessons are not only useful for when I become an employee—they will also guide me as a friend, brother, father, and even a future employer. The experience was truly eye-opening, and I am committed to applying these communication skills in every part of my life.
