# Mock Interview – STAR Responses

---

## Question 1  
**"Tell me about yourself and what motivated you to pursue your field of study."**
 
I am a final-year Application Development student, and I have spent the past few years building my technical understanding and problem-solving abilities.
My goal was to understand how technology and software can solve real-world problems and improve how people live and work.
I focused on challenging subjects, participated actively in class, collaborated with peers, and worked on projects that pushed me to improve my skills.
Through these efforts, I have gained confidence in development, system design, and teamwork. This experience has strengthened my motivation to grow as a software developer.

## Question 2  
**"Describe a project you are proud of. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?"**

I worked on a web-based system that required user login and personalised access. It was one of the largest projects I completed.
I was responsible for designing the database structure and building part of the backend logic.
I encountered several issues such as failed login attempts and incorrect table relationships. I revisited my ERD, checked documentation, tested different solutions, and asked peers for input to identify mistakes and correct them.
The project was completed successfully. I strengthened my debugging skills, improved my understanding of database design, and learned how important it is to test thoroughly.

## Question 3  
**"How do you manage deadlines when you have multiple tasks at once?"**

There was a time when I had multiple assignments, a test, and a group project due within the same period.

I needed to manage all the deadlines efficiently while still producing quality work.

I created a detailed timeline, prioritised urgent tasks, and broke larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts. I used digital tools such as Google Calendar and Notion to stay organised.

I submitted all deliverables on time and performed well. This experience helped me build a consistent method for time management that I continue to use.

## Question 4  
**"Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult teammate. What happened, and what did you do?"**


During a group project, one teammate was not contributing and missed several meetings.
As part of coordinating the team, I had to ensure everyone participated so the project could be completed successfully.
I approached the teammate respectfully and privately to understand if they were facing any challenges. We discussed expectations and agreed on clearer tasks and deadlines. I kept communication open and checked in regularly.
Their participation improved, and the team became more coordinated. The project was completed on time, and I learned valuable lessons about communication, patience, and leadership.

## Question 5  
**"Where do you see yourself in the next 2–3 years?"**


I am completing my Application Development qualification and preparing to enter the technology industry.
My goal is to develop strong technical experience and contribute meaningfully to a development team.
I am expanding my GitHub portfolio, working on personal projects, learning new programming frameworks, and preparing for internship or junior developer opportunities.

**R – Result:**  
In the next 2–3 years, I see myself working as a skilled junior developer, contributing to real projects, growing professionally, and building the foundation for a long-term career in software development.
